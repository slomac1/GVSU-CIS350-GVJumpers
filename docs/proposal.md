# Introduction

We will be creating a 2D platformer in which you can move around in an environment in order to play other 'minigames' and collect a currency( either coins, money, or tickets) in order to be able to complete a task that marks the end of the game. The possible themes of the starting area could be a Casino, Carnival, or Arcade. Potentially adding in enemies into the platformer that drop an item that can be turned in in order to play the minigames. The minigames will be simple, solo and potentially puzzle centric.
* 2D platformer as main environment
* 3 or more minigames to play
* A currency

# Anticipated Technologies

* Python
* Pygame

# Method/Approach

Will be splitting up the project into individual projects and then bring them all together later on

# Estimated Timeline

## Milestone 1: (2 weeks)
* Each member has a viable product of the game they are responsible for, including the platforming menu

## Milestone 2: (1 week)
* Begin incorporating individual games into larger formats and finish up individual projects

## Milestone 3: (1 week)
* Have everything integrated, well tested, and documented.
