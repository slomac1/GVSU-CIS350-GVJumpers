# Introduction

We will be creating a 2D platformer game with a carnival theme, which will will have booths, the booths when entered will have minigames that the player can play and collect a currency( either coins, money, or tickets) in order to be able to complete a task that marks the end of the game.

* 2D platformer as main environment
* 3 minigames:
*   1) A dartboard game
    2) A mini block puzzle game
    3) A Pinko or a card game
* A currency
