# Introduction

Still working on this, will be having a team meeting on Sunday to cover everything here and really get the ball rolling.

The main idea of this project is to have a hub in which you can play multiple games. The hub though, or menu, is an actual game as well. It will start off as a 2D platformer where you will be able to navigate to different rooms within the map and be able to launch other games. 

# Anticipated Technologies

* Python
* Pygame

# Method/Approach

Will be splitting up the project into individual projects and then bring them all together later on

# Estimated Timeline

## Milestone 1: (2 weeks)
* Each member has a viable product of the game they are responsible for, including the platforming menu

## Milestone 2: (1 week)
* Begin incorporating individual games into larger formats and finish up individual projects

## Milestone 3: (1 week)
* Have everything integrated, well tested, and documented.

# Anticipated Problems
